== Introduction

Course Title:  Lean RAG Accelerator QuickStart Training

Description:
This course teaches you how to optimize RAG deployments using Red Hat OpenShift AI 3.0 capabilities to reduce GPU costs by 50%+ and improve throughput by 2x-4x. The course combines theoretical concepts with hands-on deployment of the Lean RAG Accelerator quickstart.

Duration: FIXME hours

== Course Structure

This course includes both *training modules* and a *deployable quickstart*:

* **Training Modules**: Learn the concepts, architecture, and best practices
* **QuickStart Code**: Deployable code in `lean-rag-accelerator/` directory

== QuickStart Access

The deployable Lean RAG Accelerator quickstart is available in the repository root:

* **QuickStart README**: link:../../lean-rag-accelerator/README.md[Lean RAG Accelerator QuickStart]
* **Deployment Guide**: link:../../lean-rag-accelerator/docs/deployment-guide.md[Deployment Guide]
* **Business Value**: link:../../lean-rag-accelerator/docs/business-value-driver.md[Business Value Driver]

To get started with the quickstart:

[source,bash]
----
cd lean-rag-accelerator
./bootstrap.sh
----

Or use the Makefile:

[source,bash]
----
cd lean-rag-accelerator
make help
make deploy-all NAMESPACE=lean-rag-accelerator
----

== Topics covered in this course

*  Module 1: Inference Economics & RHOAI 3.0 Architecture

*  Module 2: Model Optimization with LLM Compressor

*  Module 3: High-Performance Serving with vLLM & llm-d

*  Module 4: Standardized RAG Implementation

*  Module 5: Validation & Benchmarking

== Prerequisites

This course assumes that you have the following prior experience:

* Red Hat OpenShift AI 3.0 installed and configured
* Basic Kubernetes knowledge (kubectl, pods, services)
* Understanding of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) concepts
* Access to a cluster with GPU nodes (NVIDIA A10G or equivalent)

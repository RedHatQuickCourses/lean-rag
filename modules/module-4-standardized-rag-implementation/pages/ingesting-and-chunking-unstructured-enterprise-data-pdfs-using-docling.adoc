= Ingesting and Chunking Unstructured Enterprise Data (PDFs) using Docling

== Module 4: Standardized RAG Implementation

In this module, we will focus on ingesting and chunking unstructured enterprise data, specifically PDFs, using Docling. This process is crucial for preparing the data for the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

=== 4.1. Understanding Docling

Docling is an open-source tool designed to extract text from various document formats, including PDFs, and convert them into a structured format suitable for machine learning tasks. It leverages advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) techniques to ensure high accuracy in text extraction.

=== 4.2. Setting Up Docling

To use Docling, you need to have Python and pip installed on your system. You can install Docling via pip:

```
pip install docling
```

Ensure you have the necessary OCR engines installed. For Tesseract, for instance, you can use:

```
sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
```

=== 4.3. Ingesting PDFs with Docling

Docling provides a simple command-line interface to ingest PDFs. Here's a basic example:

```
docling ingest --input /path/to/your/document.pdf --output /path/to/output/directory
```

This command will extract text from the PDF and save it in the specified output directory.

=== 4.4. Chunking the Ingested Data

Once the data is ingested, it needs to be chunked for efficient processing by the RAG system. Docling allows you to split the ingested text into manageable chunks.

```
docling chunk --input /path/to/output/directory --output /path/to/chunked/directory --chunk-size 1000
```

This command will split the ingested text into chunks of 1000 tokens each and save them in the specified chunked directory.

=== 4.5. Hands-On Activity: Ingesting and Chunking PDFs

1. Install Docling and the necessary OCR engines.
2. Prepare a sample PDF for ingestion.
3. Run the ingest command to extract text from the PDF

= Deploying the RAG Application Stack using GitOps and ArgoCD for Repeatability

== Objective: Standardized RAG Implementation

In this module, we will focus on deploying the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application stack using GitOps and ArgoCD for consistent and repeatable deployments. This approach ensures that our RAG system can be reliably reproduced across different environments, facilitating collaboration and reducing the risk of configuration drift.

== GitOps: Principles and Benefits

GitOps is a modern approach to application deployment and management, leveraging Git as the single source of truth for infrastructure and application configurations. Key principles of GitOps include:

1. Declarative configurations: Define the desired state of your application and infrastructure using configuration files stored in Git.
2. Automated deployments: Use continuous delivery pipelines to automatically apply changes from Git to your target environment.
3. Version control: Track all changes to your infrastructure and application configurations, enabling easy rollbacks and auditing.
4. Automated testing: Integrate automated tests to ensure the correctness of your deployments before they reach production.

Benefits of GitOps include:

* Improved collaboration and traceability
* Reduced risk of configuration drift
* Faster and more reliable deployments
* Simplified rollbacks and disaster recovery

== ArgoCD: A GitOps Continuous Delivery Tool for Kubernetes

ArgoCD is an open-source, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It enables declarative, automated deployments and management of applications on Kubernetes clusters. Key features of ArgoCD include:

1. Synchronization: ArgoCD continuously monitors the desired state defined in Git and automatically applies changes to the target Kubernetes cluster.
2. Rollbacks and promotions: ArgoCD supports easy rollbacks to previous versions and promotions of changes between environments.
3. Integration with CI/CD pipelines: ArgoCD can be integrated with popular CI/CD tools like Jenkins, CircleCI, and GitHub Actions.
4. Multi-cluster support: ArgoCD can manage applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters.

== Deploying the RAG Application Stack with GitOps and ArgoCD

To deploy the RAG application stack using GitOps and ArgoCD, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare your Kubernetes environment**: Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster set up and

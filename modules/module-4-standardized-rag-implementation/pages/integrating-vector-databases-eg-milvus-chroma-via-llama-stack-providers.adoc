= Integrating Vector Databases via Llama Stack Providers

== Objective: Standardized RAG Implementation

In this module, we will focus on integrating vector databases such as Milvus and Chroma with the Llama Stack using providers. This integration is crucial for efficient storage and retrieval of vector embeddings in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.

== Vector Databases and Llama Stack

Vector databases are designed to store and manage vector embeddings generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). They enable efficient similarity search, which is essential for RAG systems to retrieve relevant information from a large corpus of data. The Llama Stack, an open-source framework for building RAG systems, supports integration with various vector databases through providers.

== Supported Vector Databases

The Llama Stack currently supports integration with the following vector databases:

- **Milvus**: An open-source vector database manager that supports a wide range of distance metrics and index types.
- **Chroma**: A vector database built for speed and scalability, designed to handle large-scale vector embeddings.

== Integrating Vector Databases

To integrate a vector database with the Llama Stack, you need to use the respective provider. Here's a step-by-step guide using Milvus as an example:

1. **Install Milvus**: Follow the official Milvus installation guide to set up a Milvus server.

2. **Create a Collection**: In Milvus, create a collection to store your vector embeddings. Define the collection's schema, including the embedding dimension and distance metric.

3. **Index the Collection**: Create an index on the collection to optimize search performance. Milvus supports various index types, such as IVF_FLAT, HNSW, and Flat.

4. **Configure Llama Stack Provider**: In your Llama Stack configuration, specify the Milvus provider and connection details. Here's an example configuration snippet:

   ::code-block python
   providers:
     milvus:
       type: milvus
       connection:
         host: 'localhost'
         port: 19530
         timeout: 10

   vector_store: milvus
   # ... other configuration ...
   ```

5. **Insert Vectors**: Use the Llama Stack API to insert vector embeddings into the Milvus collection.

6. **Query Vectors**: Perform similarity search using

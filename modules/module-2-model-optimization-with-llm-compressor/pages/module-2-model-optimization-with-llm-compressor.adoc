= Module 2: Model Optimization with LLM Compressor

== Introduction

This module covers how to optimize LLM models using RHOAI 3.0's LLM Compressor to reduce memory footprint by 50-75% while maintaining >95% accuracy. You'll learn quantization techniques, how to use LLM Compressor, and how to access pre-optimized models from the Red Hat Model Catalog.

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- Understand quantization techniques (FP8, INT8, INT4) and trade-offs
- Use LLM Compressor to create optimized models
- Implement SmoothQuant and GPTQ quantization recipes
- Access pre-optimized models from Red Hat Model Catalog

== Module Overview

Model optimization is the first step in the Lean RAG Accelerator workflow. By reducing model size through quantization, you can:
- Serve models on smaller/cheaper GPUs
- Increase throughput (more concurrent requests)
- Reduce infrastructure costs by 50%+
- Maintain >95% accuracy in most cases

=== The Optimization Process

1. **Choose Quantization Method**: Select FP8, INT8, or INT4 based on requirements
2. **Configure Recipe**: Define QuantizationRecipe with model source and parameters
3. **Run Optimization**: Execute quantization job (30-60 minutes)
4. **Deploy Optimized Model**: Use optimized model in inference serving

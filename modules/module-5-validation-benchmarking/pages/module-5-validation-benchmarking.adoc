= Module 5: Validation & Benchmarking

== Objectives

- Define Service Level Objectives (SLOs) for Time To First Token (TTFT) and Inter-Token Latency (ITL)
- Validate throughput gains using GuideLLM to simulate real-world traffic load
- Compare performance metrics, focusing on throughput versus latency trade-offs
- Ensure the RAG system meets the established SLOs through rigorous testing and benchmarking

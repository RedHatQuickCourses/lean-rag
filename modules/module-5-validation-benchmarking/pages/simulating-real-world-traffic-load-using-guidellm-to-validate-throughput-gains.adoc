= Simulating Real-World Traffic Load Using GuideLLM to Validate Throughput Gains

== Objective

In this section, we will explore how to simulate real-world traffic load using GuideLLM to validate the throughput gains achieved through model optimization and high-performance serving.

== Introduction

To ensure that our optimized models and serving infrastructure can handle real-world workloads, it's crucial to validate their performance under conditions that mimic actual usage patterns. GuideLLM, a powerful tool for generating synthetic LLM inference requests, allows us to simulate various traffic scenarios and measure the system's throughput.

== Prerequisites

Before diving into the simulation process, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. A functioning RHOAI 3.0 inference stack with optimized models (e.g., ModelCars).
2. GuideLLM installed and configured on your local machine or a suitable testing environment.
3. Basic understanding of the Llama Stack API for orchestrating RAG workflows.

== Simulating Traffic Load with GuideLLM

1. **Define Traffic Profile**: Begin by outlining the expected traffic patterns for your specific use case. This includes estimating the number of requests per second (RPS), request distribution across different models, and latency requirements.

2. **Generate Synthetic Requests**: Utilize GuideLLM to create synthetic inference requests based on your defined traffic profile. GuideLLM supports various request formats and can generate requests that mimic real-world prompts and data distributions.

3. **Configure Load Generator**: Set up a load generator (e.g., Locust, JMeter) to send the synthetic requests generated by GuideLLM to your RHOAI 3.0 inference stack. Ensure that the load generator is capable of simulating the desired RPS and request distribution.

4. **Monitor System Performance**: During the simulation, monitor key performance metrics such as throughput, latency, and GPU/CPU utilization. This can be done using tools like Prometheus and Grafana or any other monitoring solution integrated with your RHOAI 3.0 infrastructure.

5. **Analyze Results**: After the simulation, analyze the collected performance data to validate the throughput gains achieved through model optimization and high-performance serving. Compare the results against your initial SLOs (Service Level Objectives) for Time To First Token (TTFT) and Inter-
